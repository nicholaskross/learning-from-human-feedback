# Learning to Summarize from Human Feedback (reimplemented)
Reimplementation of OpenAI's "Learning to summarize from human feedback" ([blog](https://openai.com/blog/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325), [original code](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback)).

This is being done to spin up on PyTorch and some OpenAI safety/alignment ideas. As much as possible, I'm trying to *not* look at OpenAI's code (unless I get very stuck, but that kinda hurts my learning experience, so I should minimize that). The idea is to create something to replicate their results (knowing they use PyTorch, and based on the paper).
