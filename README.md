# learning-from-human-feedback
Reimplementation of OpenAI's "Learning to summarize from human feedback" ([blog](https://openai.com/blog/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325), [original code](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback)). Done to spin up on PyTorch and some OpenAI safety/alignment ideas.
